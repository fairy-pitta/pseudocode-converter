# Python IGCSE Parser Test Summary (Updated)

## Test Execution Results

### Overview
- **Total Tests**: 42
- **Passed**: 26
- **Failed**: 16
- **Success Rate**: 61.9%

## Failed Tests (16)

### 1. should handle nested if statements
**Issue**: ENDIF placement problem in nested if-else structures
- Expected: ENDIF after inner if-else, then ELSE for outer if
- Actual: ENDIF placed incorrectly, causing structure mismatch

### 2. should handle function definition
**Issue**: Parameter type inference problem
- Expected: `PROCEDURE Greet(name : STRING)`
- Actual: `PROCEDURE Greet(name : INTEGER)`
- Problem: Type inference defaulting to INTEGER instead of STRING

### 3. should handle function with multiple parameters and types
**Issue**: Multiple parameter type inference problems
- Expected: `FUNCTION Calculate(num1 : REAL, num2 : REAL, operation : STRING) RETURNS REAL`
- Actual: `FUNCTION Calculate(num1 : INTEGER, num2 : INTEGER, operation : INTEGER) RETURNS INTEGER`
- Problem: All types defaulting to INTEGER

### 4. should handle function call
**Issue**: Function call conversion problem
- Expected: `result ← add(5, 3)`
- Actual: `result ← add(5, 3)` (appears to be working but test fails)
- Problem: Likely related to function call pattern matching or output formatting

### 5. should handle list declaration and access
**Issue**: List/array declaration and indexing problems
- Expected: `DECLARE numbers : ARRAY[0:4] OF STRING` and `numbers[0] ← "1"`
- Actual: Empty declaration and `numbers.0 ← 1` (dot notation instead of brackets)
- Problem: Array declaration not generated, indexing using dots instead of brackets

### 6. should handle list with mixed types
**Issue**: Mixed type list handling
- Details: Similar to list declaration issue above

### 7. should handle try-except block
**Issue**: Exception handling conversion
- Details: Need to check specific failure

### 8. should handle try-except-finally block
**Issue**: Exception handling with finally block
- Details: Need to check specific failure

### 9. should handle class definition
**Issue**: Class structure conversion problems
- Expected: `PRIVATE name : STRING`, `PUBLIC PROCEDURE NEW(name : STRING)`, proper method definitions
- Actual: `PROCEDURE __init__(self : INTEGER, name : INTEGER)`, TODO comments, incorrect parameter types
- Problem:
  - Constructor not converting to NEW procedure properly
  - Class attributes not becoming PRIVATE declarations
  - Method parameters defaulting to INTEGER type
  - Self assignments becoming TODO comments

### 10. should handle class inheritance
**Issue**: Inheritance handling
- Details: Need to check specific failure (likely similar to class definition issues)

### 11. should handle object instantiation and method calls
**Issue**: Object-oriented features
- Details: Need to check specific failure (likely related to class conversion issues)

### 12. should handle file operations
**Issue**: File I/O operations not properly converted
- Expected: `OPENFILE "input.txt" FOR READ`, `WHILE NOT EOF("input.txt")`, `READFILE "input.txt", line`, `CLOSEFILE "input.txt"`
- Actual: `// TODO: with open("input.txt", "r") as file:`, `FOR EACH line IN file`, `OUTPUT line.strip(`
- Problem:
  - Python's `with open()` statement converted to TODO comment
  - File operations not converted to IGCSE pseudocode format
  - Missing proper file handling commands (OPENFILE, READFILE, CLOSEFILE)

### 13. should handle file writing
**Issue**: File writing operations
- Details: Need to check specific failure

### 14. should handle break and continue in loops
**Issue**: Control flow and ENDIF placement in loops
- Expected: Proper ENDIF placement after break condition, OUTPUT before final ENDIF
- Actual: ENDIF placed immediately after EXIT FOR, OUTPUT moved after ENDIF
- Problem: Block structure management when break/continue statements are present

### 15. should handle dictionary operations
**Issue**: Dictionary to TYPE conversion problems
- Expected: Complete TYPE definition with all fields, proper field access (`student.name`), and field assignment (`student.grade ← "A"`)
- Actual: Missing `grade` field in TYPE, bracket notation in output (`student["name"]`), TODO comment for assignment
- Problem: 
  - Incomplete TYPE field detection from dictionary usage
  - Dictionary access not converting to dot notation consistently
  - Dictionary assignment creating TODO comments instead of proper conversion

### 16. Additional failed tests
**Issue**: Various other failures including:
- File writing operations (similar to file reading issues)
- Function calls (minor formatting issues)
- Class inheritance
- Object instantiation and method calls

**Note**: Some tests like "try-except blocks" and "mixed type lists" may not exist in the current test suite or have different names.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Type Inference Problems
- Parameter types defaulting to INTEGER instead of proper type inference
- Need to improve type detection from context and usage

### 2. Control Structure Issues
- ENDIF placement in nested if-else statements
- Block closing logic needs refinement

### 3. Object-Oriented Features
- Class definitions not converting to TYPE properly
- Method calls and object instantiation issues

### 4. Data Structure Handling
- List/array operations not working correctly
- Dictionary operations failing

### 5. Exception Handling
- Try-except blocks not converting properly
- Need to implement proper exception handling conversion

### 6. File Operations
- File I/O operations not implemented or working incorrectly

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Fix type inference system for function parameters
2. **Priority 2**: Resolve ENDIF placement in nested control structures
3. **Priority 3**: Implement proper object-oriented feature conversion
4. **Priority 4**: Add support for data structure operations
5. **Priority 5**: Implement exception handling and file operations

## Recent Fixes Applied
