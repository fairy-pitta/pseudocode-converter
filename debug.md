# Python to IGCSE Pseudocode Converter Debug Log

## Current Status

Debugging the `should handle function definition` test case in `__tests__/python-igcse-parser.test.ts`.
The test is failing because the function name is not being capitalized and type hints are not being added to parameters.

**Actual Output:**
```
["PROCEDURE greet(name)","OUTPUT \"Hello\", name","ENDPROCEDURE"]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
["PROCEDURE Greet(name : STRING)","OUTPUT \"Hello\", name","ENDPROCEDURE"]
```

## Investigation

- Confirmed `convertFunctionDef` in `lib/python-igcse/converters/declarations.ts` is intended to handle this.
- Checked `ALL_CONVERTERS` in `lib/python-igcse/converters/index.ts` and `convertFunctionDef` is present.
- Verified `PATTERNS.FUNCTION_DEF` in `lib/python-igcse/patterns.ts` seems correct: `/^def\s+(\w+)\(([^)]*)\)\s*:/`.
- Added logs to `convertLine` in `lib/python-igcse/parser.ts` - logs did not appear in test output, so removed.
- Added logs to `convertFunctionDef` to check invocation and regex matching.
- Corrected TypeScript errors in `convertFunctionDef` related to return type, null check for `match`, and missing `indentation` and `state` parameters.

## Identified Problems

1.  **`convertFunctionDef` Not Behaving as Expected:** Despite the logic appearing correct for capitalization and type hinting, the output doesn't reflect these changes.
2.  **Distinction between `PROCEDURE` and `FUNCTION`:** The current logic might not correctly differentiate between Python functions that should become `PROCEDURE` (no return value or return without value) and those that should become `FUNCTION` (returns a value). The user has pointed out that the presence of a `return` statement in the block is key.

## Implemented Fixes/Changes

- Modified `convertFunctionDef` in `lib/python-igcse/converters/declarations.ts` to add `console.log` for regex testing.
- Corrected TypeScript errors in `convertFunctionDef`:
    - Changed return type from `string` to `ParseResult`.
    - Corrected `if (match)` to `if (!match)` for the early return when no match is found.
    - Added `indentation: string` and `state: ParserState` to the function parameters.
- Corrected regex literal and variable name issues in `convertPrint` function within `lib/python-igcse/converters/expressions.ts`:
    - Fixed unescaped characters in the f-string regex.
    - Ensured consistent use of `rawContent` before splitting into `args` and then `content`.

## Attempted Actions

- Ran `should handle function definition` test multiple times with various logging strategies.

## Next Steps

1.  **Run Test with Corrected `convertFunctionDef` and `convertPrint`:** Execute the `should handle function definition` test case again. Although the `convertPrint` changes are not directly for this test, ensuring no new errors are introduced is important.
2.  **Analyze `convertFunctionDef` Logic (Still Pending):** Based on the logs from the *previous* test run (before `convertPrint` fixes), the `convertFunctionDef` was still not producing the correct output. If the test still fails, re-examine its internal logic for capitalizing the function name and adding type hints. The logs from the last `check_command_status` (command ID `c8c7a3f3-32af-45a9-902e-2e74f7e36a6e`) did not show the `console.log` from `convertFunctionDef`. This needs to be investigated. Perhaps the test case isn't hitting the `convertFunctionDef` converter as expected, or the logs are being suppressed.
3.  **Verify `convertFunctionDef` Invocation:** Add more prominent logging at the very beginning of `convertFunctionDef` and also in the `convertLine` method in `parser.ts` specifically when `converter.name` is `convertFunctionDef` to ensure it's being called with the correct line.
4.  **Consider `PROCEDURE` vs `FUNCTION` Distinction:** This remains a key point for future refinement once the basic function definition conversion is working.

## User Insights

*   User mentioned: "procedureとfunctionの違いはブロックの中にreturnがあるかどうかね" (The difference between procedure and function is whether there's a return in the block, right?). This is a key consideration for the pseudocode conversion logic.
